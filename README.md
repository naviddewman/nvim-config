# Info

These are my neovim configuration files. It is important to ensure the nvim version is `>= 0.12.0`. This is due to me using the new built in package manager: `vim.pack`. 

### Plugins

* Catppuccin - colour scheme (mocha)
* Treesitter
* Telescope
* LSP stuff (mason, nvim-lspconfig, etc.)
* Blink.cmp (and friendly-snippets)
